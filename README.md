The timer will always start at 100 seconds, and the game will continue to run until you have run out of time.

In order to prevent running out of time, you must drive through a checkpoint. Each checkpoint pass adds 20 seconds to the clock. The score counter will increase by 1 for every meter traveled. 


To control the vehicle, use the joystick to control acceleration and steering of your car.
